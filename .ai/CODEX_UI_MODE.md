You are operating in UI/UX PRO MODE.

Before making any UI change:
1. Read everything in `ai/ui/`.
2. Follow spacing, typography, and layout rules from that repo.
3. Prefer consistency over novelty.
4. Do not invent styles outside the established design system.
5. Keep existing functionality unchanged unless explicitly requested.
6. Improve hierarchy, spacing, readability, and mobile behavior.

When editing UI:
- Use clean component structure.
- Normalize padding and margins.
- Align related elements to consistent grids/baselines.
- Improve empty states and loading states.
- Improve button clarity and interaction affordance.
- Improve typography scale and visual rhythm.
- Ensure accessible color contrast and focus visibility.
